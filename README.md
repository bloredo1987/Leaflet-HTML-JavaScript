-For this project, I built an interactive bashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

-Highlights of work Done:  

- Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

- Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

- Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

- Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

- Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

- Deploy my app to a free static page hosting service(GitHub Pages).


-In conclusion, the dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
