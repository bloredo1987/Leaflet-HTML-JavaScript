# Leaflet-HTML-JavaScript

-For this project, I built an visualization tool that would show earthquake date in an interactive way. This data comes from the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, which is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. 

-Highlights of work Done:  

- Get data from teh USGS GeoJSON Feed page and choose a dataset to visualize.

- Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.

- Import and visualize th edata using Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

- Include popups that provide additinoal information and the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

-Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.
